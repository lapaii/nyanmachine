# nyanmachine

the nyanmachine is an assembler & "virtual machine" that can assemble and run the assembly language provided as part of the [Cambridge International AS & A Level Computer Science syllabus](https://www.cambridgeinternational.org/Images/636089-2024-2025-syllabus.pdf).

as a student studying under this syllabus, i wanted to learn more about the topics we are taught in class which is what has motivated me to persue this project.

see my [rambling](ramble.md) for more info about my approach to this project and some info about how the code works
